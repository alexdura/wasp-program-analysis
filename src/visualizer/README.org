#+TITLE: The graph visualizer VERSION 2

Because emacs somehow wrote the wrong buffer in the previous version.

* What is this

This is a script that will take a ~results.json~ file as an input, and output a dot file.

Here is how to use the script: 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python results_visualizer.py results.json # Generates a dot file
dot -Tpdf results.dot # Generates a PDF for you.
#+END_SRC
