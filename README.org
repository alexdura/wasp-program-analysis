* WASP Program Analysis Project

** Getting Started
*** Build a Docker image that contains LLVM and Phasar
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone git@github.com:alexdura/wasp-program-analysis.git

# we are importing Phasar and LLVM as submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# build the Docker image
docker build . -t wasp-pa

# enjoy!
docker run -it wasp-pa
#+END_SRC

*** Having persistent storage in the container
To do that, we use ~docker-compose~. It is a script that reads a
~docker-compose.yaml~ file to find a specification, it will run your
containers following that spec.

To start the container, write:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker-compose run wasp-pa-dev
#+END_SRC
    
This will start the container, like in the previous section, but the
directory ~./src/~ on the host will be mounted in ~/mounted/src~
inside the container.

*Warning:* It rebuilds the container, for some reason, so that might take some time.
    
*** Plugins

The =phasar_src= directory contains examples, we are particularly interested in the =plugins= examples.
